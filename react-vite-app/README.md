# React Vite App

This project is a React application set up with Vite as the build tool. Vite provides a fast development environment and optimized build process.

## Project Structure

- **public**: Contains static assets that can be served directly, such as images and icons.
- **src/assets**: Intended for storing static assets like images, fonts, or other files used in the application.
- **src/components**: For reusable React components that can be used throughout the application.
- **src/pages/HomePage.js**: Contains the `HomePage` component, which fetches data and displays it using hooks like `useEffect` and `useState`.
- **src/services/api.js**: Responsible for handling API requests, exporting functions that interact with backend services.
- **src/App.jsx**: The main application component, where routes and other components are typically defined.
- **src/main.jsx**: The entry point of the React application, where the React app is rendered into the DOM.
- **.gitignore**: Specifies files and directories that should be ignored by Git, such as `node_modules` and build artifacts.
- **index.html**: The main HTML file that serves as the entry point for the web application.
- **package.json**: Contains metadata about the project, including dependencies, scripts, and configuration for npm.
- **vite.config.js**: The configuration file for Vite, where you can customize the build and development server settings.

## Getting Started

To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. **Install Vite and React dependencies**:
   Run the following command in your project directory:
   ```
   npm install vite react react-dom
   ```

2. **Update the `package.json` scripts**:
   Replace the existing scripts with the following:
   ```json
   "scripts": {
       "dev": "vite",
       "build": "vite build",
       "serve": "vite preview"
   }
   ```

3. **Create a `vite.config.js` file**:
   This file is already present in your structure. You can configure it as needed, but a basic setup is usually sufficient for most projects.

4. **Update the entry point in `index.html`**:
   Ensure that your `index.html` file includes the correct script tag for your main JavaScript file:
   ```html
   <script type="module" src="/src/main.jsx"></script>
   ```

5. **Start the development server**:
   Run the following command to start the Vite development server:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

## Benefits of Vite

Vite is beneficial for features like hot module replacement (HMR), which allows you to see changes in your application without a full reload, significantly improving the development experience.
