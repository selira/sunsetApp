# React Frontend with Rails Backend

This project is a React application that consumes data from a Rails API backend. It is structured to provide a clean separation between the frontend and backend, allowing for easy development and maintenance.

## Project Structure

```
react-frontend
├── public
│   └── index.html          # Main HTML file for the React application
├── src
│   ├── App.js              # Main component that sets up routing
│   ├── index.js            # Entry point for the React application
│   ├── components
│   │   └── ExampleComponent.js  # Example UI component
│   ├── pages
│   │   └── HomePage.js     # Home page component that fetches data
│   └── services
│       └── api.js          # API service for making requests to the Rails backend
├── package.json             # npm configuration file
└── README.md                # Project documentation
```

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd react-frontend
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   Make sure you have Node.js installed. Then run:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the Application**
   Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

- The application uses `react-router-dom` for routing. You can navigate between different pages defined in the `src/pages` directory.
- The `HomePage` component fetches data from the Rails backend using the functions defined in `src/services/api.js`.
- You can create additional components and pages as needed to expand the functionality of the application.
